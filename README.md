Minerva is a financial data analysis program which fetches and stores time series information on financial assets and allows the user to interactively analyze returns.  Additional features presently in development.
 
The calculations are performed by a python/flask backend API using pandas and postgres SQL.

The user interface fetches and updates this data with a reactjs SPA, using components based on material-ui and redux-driven state management.
